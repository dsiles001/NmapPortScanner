# NmapPortScanner

Same idea as the previous port scanner in terms of the input, which stays the same. The user will enter the domain of the target they want to scan. They will after be prompted to enter the port(s) they want to scan. If no ports are entered, the scanner will by default scan ports 21-1024.

Output will look slightly different now. Ports are grouped under the protocol they use (ex. TCP). The status of the port will also be shown, displaying whether or not the port is open.
